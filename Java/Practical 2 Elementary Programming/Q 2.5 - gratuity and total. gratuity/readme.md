Q2.5 Write a program that reads the subtotal and the gratuity rate, 
and computes the gratuity and total. gratuity = subtotal * gratuity rate /100, total = subtotal + gratuity. 
e.g. if the user enters 10 for subtotal and 15 (percent) for gratuity rate, the program displays 1.5 as gratuity and $11.5 as total.
