Q2.2 Write a program that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius. 
         The formula for the conversion is as follows:
	celsius = (5/9) * (fahrenheit - 32)

Your program reads a Fahrenheit degree in double from the keyboard, then 
         converts it to Celsius and displays the result.

         Hint: In Java, 5/9 is 0, so you need to use 5.0/9 in the program to obtain the correct result.
